## MythoShell Installation and Setup Guide
MythoShell is a shell script project that maps common Bash commands to an Indian mythological theme. Follow the instructions below to run and make the project work on your system.

### Prerequisites:
- Make sure you have `Bash` installed on your system. Most Linux distributions come pre-installed with Bash.
- Ensure that your system has internet connectivity to download any necessary dependencies.
 
### Installing and Running the Project:
1. Clone the MythoShell repository from GitHub by running the following command:
```
   git clone https://github.com/sujal-goswami/MythoShell.git
```
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the MythoShell project.
3. Locate the shell script file that maps the commands to the theme. The file might be named something like `mythoshell.sh`.
4. Before executing the script, ensure that it has executable permissions. If not, run the command `chmod +x mythoshell.sh` to make it executable.
5. To run the MythoShell script, use one of the following commands, depending on the file's permissions:
```
   source mythoshell.sh
   . mythoshell.sh
```
   This will activate the MythoShell environment and replace the default commands with their Indian mythological language-themed alternatives.
   
6. Once the script is executed, you can start using the themed commands in your terminal. Try running ls, cd, or any other command in the list below.

### Making MythoShell Permanent:
To make MythoShell permanently available whenever you open a new terminal session, follow these steps:
1. Determine the appropriate shell startup file for your system. Common startup file names are `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshrc`. The startup file is executed every time a new terminal session is opened.
2. Add the command in end to run the MythoShell script. The command should resemble: `source /path/to/mythoshell.sh`. Replace `/path/to/mythoshell.sh` with the actual path to the `mythoshell.sh` file on your system.
3. Close and reopen your terminal, or run the command `source ~/.bashrc` (or the relevant file) to apply the changes immediately.
Now, whenever you open a new terminal session, the MythoShell environment will be automatically activated, allowing you to enjoy the Indian mythological language-themed commands.
> üìù **Note :** Ensure that the shell script file `mythoshell.sh` is placed in a location accessible by your system, and modify the startup file's path accordingly.
